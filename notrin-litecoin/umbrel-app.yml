  ⚠️If not working, update the IP address in the Docker Compose file,

  located at /home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/notrin-litecoin/docker-compose.yml,

  by replacing ip_of_umbrel_server with the actual IP address of your Umbrel server.

  After making this change, you will need to restart the Litecoin node for the changes to take effect.




  Run your Litecoin node to independently store and validate every Litecoin transaction with an easy-to-use graphical interface. 

  The litecoin.conf file is located at:

  /home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/notrin-litecoin/data
